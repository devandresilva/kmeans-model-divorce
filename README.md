# Conjugal Futures: A Machine Learning Approach to Predicting Divorces

## The Project

This repository is intended to store different code versions related to the creation of the k-means machine learning model. The main objective of this project is to develop an artificial intelligence based on machine learning that classifies couples as divorced or not divorced, using a dataset based on Gottman's couples therapy. The detailed version of the creation process is available in my Medium publication at the link below.
